# Scurri Project

1) 

The first step in our interviewing process is a short exercise that we give to all candidates. 

This exercise will enable us to get to know a little bit about your skills and experience. It should not take long to complete but if you are having any difficulty regarding time constraints, other commitments etc, please, do let us know and we won't hesitate to help you out 
In answering the code questions below, please submit code as if you intended to ship it to production. 

The details matter. 
Tests are expected, as is well written, simple idiomatic code: 

Tell us about one thing you are proud of in your career. It could be a difficult technical problem you had to solve in your work or a personal project. There is no need to go into details; a short paragraph explaining the problem and why you are proud of it would be fine. 

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Three” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Five”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “ThreeFive”.

 Write a library that supports validating and formatting post codes for UK. 
 The details of which post codes are valid and which are the parts they consist of can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcodes_in_the_United_Kingdom#Formatting. The API that this library provides is your choice.
